# django_agile_tracker
Agile stories and tasks time tracker app using Django


This is a time tracker of tasks and stories of the Agile process.

Stories and tasks are estimated separately, and time spent is recorded for tasks.

Multiple time entries can be added to tasks.

The time spent on stories is calculated by summing the time spent on tasks.

The task has the fields 'developer' and 'status', the program calculates and summarizes the estimated value of all developers and actual work done.

Developers are selected from the dropdown.
