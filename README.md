# django_agile_tracker
Agile stories and tasks time tracker app using Django


Make a time tracker of tasks and thicknesses of the Agile process.
Thicknesses and points are estimated separately, and time spent is recorded for points.
Multiple time records can be added to tasks.
The time spent by sections is calculated by summing the time spent by tasks.
The task has the field 'developer' and 'status', the program calculates and summarizes the estimated value of all developers and actual work done. Developers are selected from the dropdown.
